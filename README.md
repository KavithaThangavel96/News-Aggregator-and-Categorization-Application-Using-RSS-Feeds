# News-Aggregator-and-Categorization-Application-Using-RSS-Feeds
## Objective: 
Develop a robust application that systematically collects news articles from various RSS feeds, stores the articles in a structured database, and categorizes each 
article into predefined categories based on its content. The application will leverage Feedparser for fetching articles, SQLAlchemy for database interaction with MySQL, 
Celery for managing the task queue, and Natural Language Processing (using NLTK) for text classification, enabling users to easily access and navigate news content tailored to their interests.
